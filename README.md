### Work In Progress

## Setup Workspace

1) Install Git
```shell
sudo add-apt install git-core

```

2) Clone this repository on your local machine where ever you are comfortable to clone
```shell
git clone git@github.com:svceglug/focus-website.git
```
will clone this repository to a new folder called focus-website on Present Working Directory

3) Start coding and follow the git workflow which is below

4) We prefer more number of small pull requests rather than a huge one.

5) Congratulate yourself, you are a contributor now

#### Its not necessary that every pull request you send will be accepted but it DEFINITELY is a very good sign, you are a contributer when you send a pull request.

## Git Workflow:
1) Create a new branch for every new feature/static file you create.
```shelll
git checkout -b <yourbranch>
```
2) Code on that branch

3) Merge it to master

## Configure Text Editor.
1. Use 2 spaces of Indentation.
2. Use spaces. No Tabs.
3. No trailing whitespaces.
4. Use Unix style line endings.
5. Empty new line at the end of the file.
